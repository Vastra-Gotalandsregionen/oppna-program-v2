# Guidelines

When approving changes to selected frameworks and technologies \(new or upgrades\) the following aspects are taken into consideration:

* Väletablerad och beprövad teknik
* Lätt att rekrytera utvecklare med gedigen erfarenhet av tekniken
* "Average programmer complexity" - easy to adapt and learn
* Expected long term durability
* Avoid overlapping / redundant technology compared to what is already approved within oppna-program
* The technology must support good software engineering practices
  * Testability \(out of container driven tests e.g. unit tests\)
  * Support for dependency management
  * Continuous integration \(e.g. solutions based on the technology must be possible to build using CI-tooling\)
